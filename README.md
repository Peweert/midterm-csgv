# TrendyWeaR - Fashion E-Commerce Website

## 📝 Project Summary

**TrendyWeaR** is a modern fashion e-commerce website designed to showcase trendy clothing, provide a seamless shopping experience, and promote conscious fashion.

- **Logo:**
  - The logo was custom-designed using **Photoshop** to align with the brand’s youthful and fashionable tone.

- **Colors:**
  - **Primary color**: #0d6efd (Bootstrap Blue) – used for branding and background elements.
  - **Accent colors**: Yellow and white – used to highlight CTAs and maintain visual balance.
  - Text is contrasted against backgrounds for high readability and accessibility.
